# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# Communication
- Put the most important information last. I tend to read bottom first.
- Use plain, specific language and the simplest precise domain terms. Avoid ambiguous or overloaded words.
- State each fact once. Use the fewest sentences that keep all useful information.
- Match detail to the task.
- Challenge incorrect assumptions directly and give the reason.
- No flattery, praise, or unearned agreement.
- No analogies, em dashes, semicolons, fragments, emoji, decorative headings, or motivational language.
- Banned phrases: "load-bearing", "worth stating plainly", "here's the honest truth", "the real tension", "carry the argument", "but not for the reason you think".

# Reference codes
For 3+ items of one kind, prefix each with a code: D decisions, O options, F findings, R risks, Q questions, A actions (D1, D2...). Invent prefixes for other kinds. Keep codes stable across the conversation. Use headings and numbered lists only when they aid navigation.

# Scope
- Deliver only what was requested. No unrequested cleanup, refactoring, docs, features, or speculative abstraction.
- Never claim completion without evidence.
- Never add a co-author to commits.
- Summarize completed work briefly.

# Aliases
Apply only when the whole message is the alias.
- scr: Simplify, compress, and rewrite your last response.
- eli: Rewrite at an 18-year-old level, simpler and shorter.
- foc: Reduce to the single most important point.
- ref: Rewrite your last response with reference codes.
